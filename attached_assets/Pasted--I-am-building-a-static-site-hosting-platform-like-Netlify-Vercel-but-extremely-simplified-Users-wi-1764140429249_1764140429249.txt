I am building a static-site hosting platform like Netlify/Vercel but extremely simplified. Users will upload a ZIP file containing HTML/CSS/JS, and my system will host their site at a path-based URL:
https://kenime.cc/<username>/ instead of subdomains.
The platform is static-only: no server-side languages, no backend execution, no containers.

Build the entire system architecture, UI, backend, and feature set based on the following required features:


---

1. Hosting Method

All websites are hosted via folder-based routes: /sites/<username>/...

Public URL for a site: kenime.cc/<username>/

Use Vercel rewrites to map: /username/* → /sites/username/*

Ensure no wildcard subdomains are used.



---

2. User System

Signup/Login

Username selection

Dashboard showing list of sites


Basic rate limits (upload limit, daily deploy limit, max sites per user)



---

3. Upload & Publish Flow

Upload ZIP

Extract into /sites/<username>/

Replace old site when publishing

Preview mode: /preview/<id>/

Publish button moves preview → live

Auto-detect missing index.html

Error if structure is invalid

Block disallowed file types (PHP, EXE, PY, SH, binaries)



---

4. File Manager

Minimal:

Upload ZIP

Replace site

Delete site

Auto-folder clean on replace


Optional:

Browser file editor (Monaco)

Drag-drop file upload

Create/delete files



---

5. Analytics

Total views

Last updated

Storage used

Bandwidth estimate

Simple pageview counter (DB or KV)



---


---

7. SEO Tools

Auto-generate sitemap per site

Basic meta tag generator

Favicon generator

Check for missing <title> or broken links



---

8. Security

Strip all backend files

Limit file size

Sanitize file names

Enforce static-only content

Rate limit uploads

Disallow scripts with server-side intent

Ensure clean routing (no escape from folder)

Scan uploaded ZIP for malicious content



---

9. Admin Features

View all sites

Delete abusive sites

Ban users

Usage overview

Global analytics

IP logging (basic)

Takedown system



---

10. Routing & Vercel Setup

Generate complete configuration:

vercel.json rewrite rules

API structure for uploads

Folder structure: /sites/<username>/

Middleware to dynamically route paths

Serve static files correctly

Prevent directory traversal

Preview URL routing



---

11. DB Structure [ use supabase]

Include tables for:

Users

Sites

Deployments

Analytics (views, hits, storage size)

Templates

Rate limits

Admin logs



---

12. UI/UX Design

Dashboard must include:

“Create new site”

“Upload ZIP”

“Preview / Publish”

“Replace site”

“Delete site”

“Analytics” Section

Storage usage meter

File manager (if chosen)

Settings: username, display name, password change



---

13. Hard Requirements

Static-only

No subdomains

All hosted under /username/

All sites must work even with relative assets

Vercel must be able to serve all static content

The system must scale to thousands of users
